        <p> Google Fonts is a library of 1513 open source font families and APIs for

            convenient use via CSS and Android. The library also has delightful and
      
            beautifully crafted icons for common actions and items. Download them for
      
            use in your digital products for Android, iOS, and web.</p>
           
            <p>Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to
      
            explore, sort, and test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We
      
            showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving you valuable
      
            information about the typographers and their process, as well as analytics
      
            on usage and demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you
      
            discover new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of
      
            designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort organizes

            fonts based on popularity, trends, and your geographic location. You can

            also create your own highly customized collections by filtering families,
      
            weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and review sample copy.
      
            Collections can be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and
      
            ensure typography is optimized and streamlined throughout the design and
      
            engineering process. In 2021, we added icons to our Google Fonts catalog,
      
            expanding expressive capability for our users. Our first set was the
      
            Material iconsâ€”delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common
      
            communication needs. Download them on desktop to use them in your digital
      
            products for Android, iOS, and web.
