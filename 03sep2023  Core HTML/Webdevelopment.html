        <p> Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. This
            involves a combination of different technologies and programming languages, such as HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript, to create webpages and make them interactive.
        <br/>
            Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and
            back-end development. Front-end development deals with the visual aspects of a website or
            application, including the design, layout, and user interface. This involves working with
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.
