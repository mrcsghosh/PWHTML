      <h1>Tag</h1>
      <p>In HTML, a tag is a code that defines an element on a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, like <tag>, and they provide instructions for the browser on how to display content. </p>

      <h2>Elements</h2>
      <p>An element, in HTML, is created by enclosing content within a pair of opening and closing tags. Together, the opening tag, content, and closing tag form an element. Elements are the building blocks of web pages, and they define the structure and content of the page. </p>
