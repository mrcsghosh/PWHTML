    <h2>"DOCTYPE declaration"</h2>
    <p>The "DOCTYPE declaration" in HTML stands for Document Type Declaration. It's not enclosed in angle brackets like HTML tags, but it's a crucial statement that specifies the version of HTML that a web page is using. The DOCTYPE declaration informs the web browser about the type of document it is going to render, which in turn influences the rendering and parsing of the HTML code.</p>


   <!-- <!DOCTYPE html>-->

   <!--However, with HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is simplified, making it easier for developers to create web pages that conform to the latest standard.-->
